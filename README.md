# QTM150
This is a final project for my quantiative sciences class. Because Emory is located in a suburb of Atlanta, 
off campus dining options for students are limited. With that in mind, I was interested in how often students at off campus,
specifically at Emory Village, a small collection of stores a 5 minute walk from campus.
